#Notes on federal employee viewpoint survey


#------- Big picture:
We've asked federal employees questions about their work,
and gotten the demongraphic data. Finaly, we know whether they
plan to leave the job.

#------- Problem:
People want to leave, and we want to know why.
We'll try to use the questions we asked and demographic data to find out

#------- Upload and glance:
Outcome variable is DLEAVING
Outcome has 4 options (need to simplify these)
We have 71 questions with ordinal responses.
Most of these are fully ordinal, but some coersed to strings because of a "don't know" option
Also have 7 categorical demongraphic predictors and agency things

#------- Clean/Prepare data:
#check the Read Me file and the Codebook spreadsheet
Tasks to prepare data:
	coding:
	1. data is encoded with letters, will make a function for translating these back out when plotting
	
	outcome:
	1. remove individuals we don't know response
	2. create new 'leaving' variable that is yes or no

	questions
	1. check how many "don't knows" there are, if new, impute these to median
	2. choose whether each should be ordinal or not
	
	demongraphic
	1. these also have missing data. Since they are categorical, imputing is tricky. How to handle depends on what we want to know

	Are any demographic groups or agencies particularly prone to leaving?
